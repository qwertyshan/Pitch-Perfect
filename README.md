# Pitch Perfect: Recording and modulating sounds

Pitch Perfect was developed as an experimental iPhone app. It allows users to record their voice and then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app also lets the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.

**Developed in Xcode using Swift 2.0.**

## Experiment Goals

* Create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard, with buttons, colors, alignments, etc.
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Use Delegates in code.
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundationâ€™s AVAudioEngine class
